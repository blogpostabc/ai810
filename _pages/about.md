# Announcing Accepted Blogposts

>The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) is proud to announce the fourth edition of its Blogposts Track, our 2022 established publication venue to address the lack of up-to-date educational, critical, and insightful communications in the fast-paced fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The Blogposts Track offers a unique venue to discuss recent developments, research directions, and reflect on past work while offering accessible education.
>Over the past years, the Blogposts Track has seen increasing engagement, reinforcing its role in supporting an open exchange of ideas within the machine learning community. By providing a platform for blog post publications, ICLR continues to support knowledge exchange in our research community.
>Thanks to the growing interest in this format, the track received **96 submissions**, with **48** exceptional blog posts accepted after a double-blind review. These posts explore a variety of topics in machine learning, offering unique educational, critical, and reflective positions.
>
>Among the large list of this year's notable contributions, we would like to highlight
>- ***Flow With What You Know*** - provides an accessible introduction to flow-matching and rectified flow models by exploring the physical representation of the involved processes.
>
> as best blog post, with
>- ***Intricacies of Feature Geometry in Large Language Models*** - reflects on the geometry of a language model's embedding space. While recent works found structured geometry corresponding to concepts, this blog posts uncovers that these trivially arise in high-dimensional spaces.
>- ***Understanding Model Calibration - A gentle introduction and visual exploration of calibration and the expected calibration error (ECE)*** - provides a gentle introduction into model calibration and discusses the use of the commonly used expected calibration error as evaluation metric.
>
>as close runner-ups. These contributions underscore the Blogposts Track mission to promote meaningful, high-quality scientific dialogue and educational communication across machine learning.
>
>To encourage engagement, the accepted blog posts will be featured in a poster session at ICLR in Singapore from April 24th to April 28th. These "Affinity Posters" sessions will provide a forum for direct discussions between authors and attendees.
>All accepted blog posts are available on the Blog page of the track's website.
